This project was created solely to simplify the work of modders with the scripts of the game Total War: Attila and hopefully will help to quickly and effectively create large-scale story additions. 
To demonstrate the work, I selected the modification "Fireforged Empire" by grif79

When creating the mechanics, I was inspired by the work of The Creative Assembly, Ltd. development team, 
modifications of "Fall of the Eagles + Europa Perdita Revised" by Aurelinus & lsoft https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1494368909 
and "Fireforged Empire" by grif79
